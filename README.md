# Train-Scheduler
# Welcome to my little exercise on moment.js and Firebase
# It uses Firebase to receive, store, and send data from a database.
# It uses Moment.js to keep track of the time and to decide when the next train arrival is due. 
# To use, fill out the form and view your results displayed in the Current Train Schedule window.
